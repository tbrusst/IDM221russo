	<h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
		<p> I worked on my personal logo a couple years ago and have stuck with it ever since. I am proud of my logo, especially for my level of expertise at the time of its creation. The concept came from a visual of a knight's helmet. It was a symbol of power to me as well as being an interesting shape when abstracted. I saw one and instantly thought of the potential shape I could create from it. The project was originally done entirely in PhotoShop. I have since created versions in Illustrator and in 3d programs such as Cinema 4d. </p>
