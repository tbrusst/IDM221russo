	<h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
		<p> I took a picture of my friend's hand while he was smoking on the steps outside his building. I really liked the composition on the picture. I was also working a lot more in Illustrator at the time and wanted to get more comfortable with the program. With some basic line work and simplistic shading I ended up with the base hand. Then I ended up adding simple repitive line elements to fill the background. I wanted them to emulate light shining through shades. The final product does not use any crazy techniques but displays my mastery with design elements and composition. </p>
