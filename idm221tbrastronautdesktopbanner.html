	<h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
		<p> This project originally started as a youtube banner for a graphic design contest. It is one of the better photo manipulation/designs that I have done in the past. I was proud of the design so I ended up expanding the banner into a full desktop using some blur and cropping. </p>
