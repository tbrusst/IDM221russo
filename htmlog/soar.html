		<p> This is one of my early designs. I began graphic design several years ago because of my interest in youtube and its many communities. I began noticing the custom art users were receiving for their channels. Designers were flocking to YouTube and social media sites to build branding for popular users. Soar Sniping was an extremely popular YouTube channel so I decided to build a mock up for their channel just to practice some new designs. This banner would be at the top of their channel page and would link to their social media and sponsors. </p>
