	<h2> ABOUT </h2>
		<p> 	My name is Brendan Russo and I am a web designer and developer. I grew up in small town Massachusetts but have moved to Philadelphia, PA to attend Drexel University for Interactive Digital Media. This major focuses on all kinds of digital media. Subjects within my plan of study are meant to enhance my grasp on digital media in general and the many interactions involved within the field. I personally have started to develop certain interests around digital media as well. </p>

		<p> 	I seek to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and everything they can offer. Building websites is extremely interesting to me. I started digital design in middle school and web development is the next step in enhancing my skills. I have a strong grasp on digital design principles and the software related to it. My undergraduate education will teach me how to translate my design skills into the browser. </p>

		<p>		My interests are not as simple as just web development, however. I want to redesign interaction. UX is the most interesting field within digital media to me. I feel as though we are on the cusp of some great things in UX. Although most UX is done for a browser, I want to think larger. I want to design UX for physical spaces. Technology has advanced to a place where I feel confident I could build a storefront that centers itself around digital media.</p>
		
		<p>		I am excited to improve my digital skills and get out into the world. I hope I can work in UX and work on some projects close to my interests. I know that I am capable of doing great work and making people think of digital media in a different light.  </p>
