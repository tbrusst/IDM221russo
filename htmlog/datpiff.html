		<p> In my User Interface 1 course the final assignment was to redesgin the UI of a real site with an unappealing design. I chose to look at the site datPiff.com. This site is a music sharing site focused on rap/hip-hop mixtapes. It does recieve a lot of attention and is seen as the go-to site for free mixtapes. I personally used this site a handful of times to download and listen to music. There are a lot of noticable issues on the site. The design is not very strong and the process of streaming music is quite difficult.

    I built images in PhotoShop and linked them together with Invision to emulate their functionality. I mainly focused on the new streaming page and profile pages. The best features on the site should include listening and sharing. Profiles house users favorite music as well as their interactions with other users. The streaming page is where users listen to music.
